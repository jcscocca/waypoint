# Statistical Route And Place Comparison

## What The App Can Claim

The app can say that one route or site has a statistically lower reported-incident rate
than another route or site for the selected date range, geography, radius, offense filter,
and method. This claim is scoped to the public SPD incident records and the exact analysis
inputs used for the comparison.

The app cannot say that a route is safe, unsafe, dangerous, risk-free, or that a route prevents crime.

## Why Raw Counts Are Not Enough

Raw incident counts do not account for route length, buffer size, or analysis period. A
longer route corridor or larger place buffer can include more incidents simply because it
covers more area. A longer analysis period can include more incidents simply because it has
more days. The app compares exposure-adjusted rates so that each option is evaluated against
the amount of area and time included in that option's analysis.

## Exposure

Place exposure is the selected place buffer area in square kilometers multiplied by the
number of analysis days. Route exposure is the selected route corridor area in square
kilometers multiplied by the number of analysis days.

For route comparisons, the corridor area is calculated as:

```text
route_corridor_area_square_km = (route_length_km * 2 * radius_km) + pi * radius_km^2
```

The exposure unit for both place and route comparisons is square-kilometer-days.

## Incident Inclusion

An incident is included only when it has coordinates, falls within the selected date range,
matches the selected offense filters, and falls inside the selected place buffer or route
corridor. Incidents outside the selected geography, dates, or offense filters are excluded
from the count and rate calculation.

## Statistical Test

The default test is an exact conditional Poisson comparison of exposure-adjusted incident
rates. If period counts are overdispersed, the app uses a quasi-Poisson log-rate-ratio
adjustment so the uncertainty estimate reflects extra variation in the observed counts.

## Multiple Comparisons

When more than two options are compared, the app applies a Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to
control the false discovery rate across pairwise comparisons. An option is recommended only
when it passes the conservative threshold against every relevant alternative.

## Recommendation Threshold

- adjusted p-value below 0.05
- adjusted rate ratio less than or equal to 0.80
- at least 30 analysis days
- positive exposure for every compared option
- combined incident count of at least 10
- no unhandled model warning

## Dashboard Modes

Overview is the public summary view. It shows the reader-facing summary text, the decision
class, adjusted rates, and a short caveat that keeps the claim tied to reported incidents
and the selected inputs.

Analytical is the audit view. It shows the supporting counts, exposure, rate ratio,
confidence interval, p-values, method, overdispersion status, minimum-data status, filters,
and full caveats.

Both modes read the same backend result. They differ only in how much of the result they
show.

## Decision Classes

`statistically_lower` means one compared option has a statistically lower reported-incident
rate under the selected filters and threshold.

`not_statistically_clear` means the comparison does not identify a statistically clear
lower reported-incident rate.

`insufficient_data` means the selected inputs do not meet the minimum data requirements.

`model_warning` means the model produced a warning that should prevent a recommendation
claim.
