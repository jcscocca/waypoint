# Mobility Context Analyzer

Backend-first MVP for a privacy-first mobility context tool. The app accepts personal
location-history uploads, turns them into stop visits and recurring place clusters, compares
those recurring areas with reported Seattle SPD crime incidents, and exports a Tableau-ready
CSV that avoids raw GPS traces.

## What It Does

- Imports Google Maps/Timeline JSON and CSV point files.
- Includes minimal GeoJSON and GPX point adapters so those formats have clean seams.
- Normalizes uploads into stop visits and recurring place clusters.
- Marks home-like and work-like clusters for privacy suppression.
- Loads a local Seattle crime fixture for offline tests and demo work.
- Computes reported SPD incident counts within selected radii and date ranges.
- Exports privacy-safe Tableau CSV rows using generalized display coordinates.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not score safety or label places as safe or unsafe.
- It does not claim a user was present when an incident occurred.
- It does not expose raw GPS observations in Tableau exports.
- It does not implement real authentication, encryption at rest, or tenant isolation yet.
- It does not run live Socrata ingestion in unit tests.

## Privacy Posture

Raw uploads are temporary input artifacts. The canonical product objects are stop visits,
recurring place clusters, and context summaries. Demo identity comes from the
`X-Demo-User-Id` header, or `demo_user` when omitted, and is hashed server-side.

In `tableau_safe` mode, home-like, work-like, health-like, religious-like, and explicitly
suppressed clusters are excluded from the Tableau export by default. Exported coordinates use
`display_latitude` and `display_longitude`; if those are missing, the exporter rounds exact
centroids to a coarse grid.

TODO: add production authentication, encryption at rest, per-user tenant isolation, upload
retention controls, and explicit user-facing consent screens.

## Local Setup

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
cp .env.example .env
```

Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run the API with SQLite defaults:

```bash
make run
```

Run with Postgres/PostGIS:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Apply migrations manually:

```bash
make migrate
```

## Demo Flow

Start the API, then upload the recurring Google fixture:

```bash
curl -F "file=@tests/fixtures/google_recurring.json" \
  -H "X-Demo-User-Id: demo@example.com" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/imports
```

Normalize the returned import id:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-Demo-User-Id: demo@example.com" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/imports/<import_id>/normalize
```

Load sample crime data and summarize:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/crime/ingest/sample
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Demo-User-Id: demo@example.com" \
  -d '{"analysis_start_date":"2024-01-01","analysis_end_date":"2024-01-31","radii_m":[250]}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/crime/summarize
```

Export Tableau CSV:

```bash
curl -H "X-Demo-User-Id: demo@example.com" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/exports/tableau/place-summary.csv
```

## Supported Upload Formats

- Google Semantic Location History JSON with `timelineObjects`.
- Google records-style JSON with `locations`, `latitudeE7`, and `longitudeE7`.
- CSV with `timestamp`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and optional `accuracy_m`,
  `activity_type`, and `source`.
- Minimal GeoJSON Point/LineString support.
- Minimal GPX track point support.

## Tableau Export

The export is available at:

```text
GET /exports/tableau/place-summary.csv
```

It includes recurring-place fields, generalized coordinates, selected analysis range,
crime grouping fields, incident counts, nearest incident distance, incidents per visit, and
incidents per hour of dwell. Product language should describe rows as:

> Reported SPD incidents within 500m of this recurring location during the selected date range.

## Data Caveats

Seattle SPD open data contains reported incidents. Reported crime data can be incomplete,
delayed, corrected, or geographically generalized. Personal location history can also be
incomplete, inaccurate, or biased by device behavior. This tool provides context summaries,
not safety predictions.

The default Socrata dataset id is `tazs-3rd5`, the City of Seattle's "SPD Crime Data:
2008-Present" dataset.
